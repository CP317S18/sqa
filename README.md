The software quality assurance logs can be accessed via [google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mxeb-O8q5lSGEQVzEIIoYGkT9QRoxtuHq5hOoGGWJCI/edit?usp=sharing) or downloaded as an .xlsx file. 

The document contains logs of the following:
* contribution logs

* anaylsis SQA logs
* design SQA logs
